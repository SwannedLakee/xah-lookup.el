# Emacs settings

Collection of Emacs settings that I find useful

## Features

For details, take a look at [org-init.org](https://codeberg.org/timmli/.emacs.d/src/branch/master/org-init.org).

The most elaborate parts (since I use them most) are probably: 

- Org mode
- mu4e
- Helm
- Dired
- Hydra

## Installation

Just clone this repository into `~/.emacs.d`.

But I recommend to use my settings as a source of inspiration for creating your own settings.
